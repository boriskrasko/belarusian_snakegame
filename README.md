# Snake game, Belarusian style. 

A snake-styled game for [Belsat TV](www.belsat.eu) by me and designer Eugen Waszkielewicz. Made in summer 2020 during the peace protests in Belarus. People were gathering in queues near the Parlaiment, KGB headquarters and other places to show disagreement with political situation in the country.

A player need to collect national flags to grow the queue and avoid policemen/police buses.
